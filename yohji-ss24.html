    Yohji Yamamoto has defined Japanese fashion since 1977, debuting his namesake label defined by avant-garde silhouettes cemented in black. The designer is in a world of his own, becoming a master tailor, craftsman, and storyteller pushed to the present day.

    Yamamoto’s Spring/Summer 2024 menswear collection explored the good, bad, and ugly sides of fashion, seeing his womenswear offering expand his dark and eerie universe. The showcase was held inside Paris’ city hall, originally built between 1535 and 1628 by Henry IV and Louis XIII. Grand carpeted staircases led friends, family, and industry insiders to a prehistoric room with glowing chandeliers, divided by a long, white runway where models debuted a cohesive collection of extravagant evening wear.
